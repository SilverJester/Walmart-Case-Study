# About Walmart  

Walmart is an American multinational retail corporation that operates a chain of supercenters, discount departmental stores, and grocery stores from the United States. Walmart has more than 100 million customers worldwide.  

## Business Problem  

The Management team at Walmart Inc. wants to analyze customer purchase behavior (specifically, purchase amount) against customer gender and various other factors to help the business make better decisions.  

They want to understand if spending habits differ between male and female customers:  
ðŸ“Œ **Do women spend more on Black Friday than men?**  
(Assume 50 million customers are male and 50 million are female.)  

## Dataset  

The company collected transactional data of customers who purchased products from Walmart Stores during Black Friday.
